   - **Example**: Values like "$10.42", "$22.86", "$25.75" were sorted as text strings, not by numeric value
   - **Root Cause**: Collection API was falling back to sorting by card name for price columns instead of implementing proper numerical sorting

2. **‚úÖ NUMERICAL SORTING IMPLEMENTED**:
   - **Solution**: Enhanced collection API with proper price-based sorting using SQL window functions
   - **Implementation**: Added subquery to get latest price snapshot per card with `row_number()` window function
   - **Price Join**: Uses `outerjoin` with latest prices subquery to sort by actual `ungraded_cents` and `psa10_cents` values
   - **Null Handling**: Implemented `nulls_last()` to put cards without pricing data at the end regardless of sort direction

3. **‚úÖ TECHNICAL DETAILS**:
   - **Window Function**: Uses `func.row_number().over(partition_by=card_id, order_by=as_of_date.desc())` to get latest prices
   - **Subquery Optimization**: Creates efficient subquery that filters to only latest price snapshot per card (`rn = 1`)
   - **Query Rebuilding**: For price sorts, rebuilds query with price join and re-applies all filters
   - **Sort Direction**: Properly handles both ascending and descending sorts with null value handling

4. **‚úÖ RESULT**:
   - **Numerical Sorting**: Price columns now sort by actual dollar amounts (e.g., $10.42 < $22.86 < $25.75)
   - **Performance**: Efficient SQL query with proper indexing on `card_id` and `as_of_date`
   - **User Experience**: Sorting by price columns now works as expected with proper numerical ordering
   - **Backward Compatibility**: All other column sorting remains unchanged and functional

**üö® DOCKER DEPLOYMENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED (August 14, 2025)**:

### **CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT PROBLEMS**:
1. **‚úÖ DOCKER PUBLISHING WORKING**: Successfully pushed to Docker Hub and deployed on Unraid
2. **‚ùå LOG DIRECTORY CREATION FAILURE**:
   - **Issue**: Application fails to start because `/data/logs/` directory doesn't exist
   - **Error**: Had to manually create log directory for container to start
   - **Root Cause**: `app/logging.py` calls `os.makedirs(logs_dir, exist_ok=True)` but this may fail due to permissions or timing
   - **Impact**: Container fails to start without manual intervention

3. **‚ùå DATABASE ACCESS FAILURE**:
   - **Error**: `sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file`
   - **Root Cause**: SQLite cannot access `/data/app.db` - likely directory permissions or missing parent directories
   - **Impact**: Application cannot initialize database, complete startup failure
   - **Logs**: Multiple startup attempts all failing with same database error

4. **‚ùå DIRECTORY INITIALIZATION ISSUES**:
   - **Problem**: Docker container doesn't properly ensure all required directories exist with correct permissions
   - **Missing**: Robust directory creation in startup sequence
   - **Needed**: Automatic creation of `/data/` and `/data/logs/` with proper ownership

### **UNRAID CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS**:
- **Container Name**: `pkmn-cataloguer`
- **Repository**: `csek06/pkmn-cataloguer` ‚úÖ CORRECT
- **Port Mapping**: `8000:8000` ‚úÖ CORRECT
- **Data Directory**: `/data` mapped to `/mnt/user/appdata/pkmn-cataloguer` ‚úÖ CORRECT
- **Environment Variables**: `DATA_DIR=/data`, `SECRET_KEY` configured ‚úÖ CORRECT
- **User**: Running as non-root `appuser` ‚úÖ CORRECT (but may cause permission issues)

### **DEPLOYMENT SELF-CONTAINMENT ISSUES**:
1. **‚ùå DIRECTORY CREATION**: App doesn't reliably create required directories on first run
2. **‚ùå PERMISSION HANDLING**: Non-root user may not have permissions to create directories
3. **‚ùå STARTUP ROBUSTNESS**: No graceful handling of missing directories during initialization
4. **‚ùå DATABASE INITIALIZATION**: Database creation fails if parent directory doesn't exist

**‚úÖ QUANTITY-TO-ZERO DELETION CONFIRMED WORKING (August 14, 2025)**:

### **QUANTITY CONTROL SYSTEM VERIFICATION**:
1. **‚úÖ ZERO QUANTITY DELETION IMPLEMENTED**:
   - **API Logic**: `update_collection_entry()` checks `if qty <= 0` and deletes entry
   - **Database Cleanup**: Entry is removed from database with proper logging
   - **Template Logic**: Minus button uses conditional HTMX swap (`delete` vs `outerHTML`)
   - **User Experience**: Reducing quantity to 0 removes card from collection instantly

2. **‚úÖ SMART HTMX SWAP BEHAVIOR**:
   - **At qty=1**: Minus button uses `hx-swap="delete"` to remove table row
   - **At qty>1**: Minus button uses `hx-swap="outerHTML"` to update row
   - **Template Conditional**: `{% if entry.qty <= 1 %}delete{% else %}outerHTML{% endif %}`
   - **Result**: Seamless UI behavior for both quantity changes and item removal

3. **‚úÖ COMPLETE QUANTITY MANAGEMENT**:
   - **Increment**:
